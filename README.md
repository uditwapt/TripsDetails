Inside are shops swaddled in bright embroideries, a royal palace and numerous businesses looking for your tourist rupee. Despite the commercialism , its hard not to be enchanted by this desert citadel. Beneath the ramparts, particularly to the north, the narrow streets of the old city conceal magnificent havelis, all carved from the same golden-honey sandstone as the fort- hence Jaisalmer’s designation as the Golden City.

##Delhi-Weekend-udaipur

WanderOn Weekend Trip udaipur (2 Nights/3 Days)

About:
Beside shimmering Lake Pichola, with the ochre and purple ridges of the wooded Aravalli Hills stretching away in every direction, Udaipur has a romance of setting unmatched in Rajasthan and arguably in all India. Fantastical palaces, temples, havelis and countless narrow, crooked, timeless streets add the human counterpoint to the city’s natural charms. For the visitor there’s the tranquillity of boat rides on the lake, the bustle and colour of ancient bazaars, a lively arts scene, the quaint old-world feel of its better hotels, endless tempting shops and some lovely countryside to explore on wheels, feet or horseback.
Udaipur’s tag of ‘the most romantic spot on the continent of India’ was first applied in 1829 by Colonel James Tod, the East India Company’s first political agent in the region. Today the romance is wearing slightly thin as ever-taller hotels compete for the best view and traffic clogs ancient thoroughfares.


Itinerary:
➤ 
Day 1: Udaipur
➤ Depart from Delhi on the evening of the starting date of the trip.
➤ Travel overnight to reach Udaipur in the morning on Day 1.
➤ Check in the hotel. Freshen up and go on to explore lake Pichola.
➤ Experience the serene boat ride in magestic Lake Pichola.
➤ Visit Sajjangarh Fort. An amazing view of Fateh Sagar Lake and Lake Pichola awaits you as you reach on the top of the hill upon which Sajjangarh Fort is situated.
➤ Next up is Fateh Sagar Lake. The most beautiful lake in the city of lakes.
➤ Reach back hotel for dinner and sleep overnight.

Day 2: Udaipur City Palace
